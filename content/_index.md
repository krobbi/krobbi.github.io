Welcome to my newly-designed personal website! I've been thinking about making
it more capable of hosting other pages for a while, but I've finally gotten
around to it!

Eventually this site could become a part-blog, part-portfolio worth visiting on
its own, but for now it's mostly "under construction".

## Design
The previous design only had a landing page with huge responsive links to
social media sites. It looked cool, but it would be difficult to fit in more
content. The hot new feature that solves this problem is the navbar at the top
of the page! (Don't get too excited.) The navbar will allow me to add new
sections to the site and even provide some decoration for boring text-only
pages.

Flat design is going out of style. I've added a (non-vector) banner image, put
serifs on the headings and even sprinkled in a few gradients. I wanted to add a
dark theme, but I couldn't get the colours to look good. Maybe later.

## Blogging
I don't blog, but maybe I will with this new site. Even if I don't, I will need
to learn [Hugo](https://gohugo.io)'s content management system to use this site
effectively as a portfolio.

## Links
{{< nav aria-label="Social media" >}}
You might want access to the social media links I used to have on the homepage,
so here they are:
* [GitHub](https://github.com/krobbi)
* [Bandcamp](https://krobbizoid.bandcamp.com)
* [SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com/krobbizoid)
