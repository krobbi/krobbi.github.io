I have produced electronic music with {{% link lmms %}} - a free,
open-source digital audio workstation (DAW) - since 2016. I don't usually try
to make a specific genre. The result is usually something melodic and pop-y,
with some influences from ambient music.

## Demo
I plan to add a discography to this section of the site. Until then, enjoy this
demo of an unfinished song, "Above the Clouds":
