I have produced electronic music with [LMMS](https://lmms.io) since 2016. This
page may later contain my discography when I get the hang of the website's
content management system.

## Demo
This page exists to justify the navbar's existence. To justify this page's
existence, here's a demo of an unfinished song, "Above the Clouds":

(Apologies for any issues with audio quality, GitHub pages isn't ideal for
hosting large files.)
