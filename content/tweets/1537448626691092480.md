        A code snippet of a complex expression. A window to the right displays
        the expression interpreted as an abstract syntax tree and as
        stack-based bytecode.

    This image shows a more recent test of 'NightScript' - a custom scripting
    language for {{< link coldestNight >}}. It had been rewritten to scan the
    source code as tokens, and parse them as an abstract syntax tree. This
    allowed arbitrary expressions to be parsed and compiled. The bytecode used
    to run it was also changed to be stack-based to handle these expressions.

Ok, ASTs and stacks are pretty cool I guess.
