        A long paragraph of white monospaced sample text on a black background.
        The text is wrapped before it reaches a vertical green bar to the right
        of the text. The text avoids being wrapped in the middle of words.

        The green bar has been moved further to the left. The text still avoids
        being wrapped in the middle of words. The word "characteristics" is too
        long to fit, and is hypenated across two lines.

        The space to the left of the green bar is now only five characters
        wide. Many words are hypenated across multiple lines. Some of the
        longer words are hypenated across three or more lines.

        The space to the left of the green bar is now only a single character
        wide. The sample text is displayed vertically.

Been improving my text wrapping algorithm thing.
