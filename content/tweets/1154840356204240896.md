        Pixel art resembling a blue jay feather. It has a black outline
        surrounded by another white outline. To the left is a copy of the same
        shape, but without a white outline and filled with a transparent red
        colour.

    This image shows a design for a stamina meter in my unfinished game
    'Canopy'. "Birb" - meaning 'bird' - was a meme from several years before
    this Tweet.
