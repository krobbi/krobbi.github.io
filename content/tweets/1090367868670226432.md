        A tile-based side-scrolling video game level. The player is represented
        with a solid red box. Text in the top-left corner displays the player
        and camera's positions and a "flying power" stat.

    "Birb" - meaning 'bird' - was a meme from several years before this Tweet.
    "Improvve" is a typo.
