        A tile-based top-down video game level. A player and an enemy are
        represented with rectangles. The enemy's vision cone is displayed as
        two concentric triangular hitboxes and an arrow pointing at the player.
        The vision cone and the shape of the level are also displayed on a
        Metal Gear Solid-style radar.

Update to the stealth prototype thing:\
Radar can show walls and decorations.\
Occlusion collision layer with raycast to test visibility.\
Field of view expands slightly on entering to prevent weird loops.\
Maybe will eventually become a less blatant Metal Gear ripoff.\
