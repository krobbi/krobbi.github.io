    After creating NightScript for {{% link coldestNight %}} I became
    interested in programming language design. I started learning the C
    programming language while following the book
    '[Crafting Interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com/)'.

Accidentally pass false (which is really just 0) instead of a pointer
(which is really just an integer). Program compiles with no issues, but
sometimes silently crashes from accessing memory out of bounds.\
