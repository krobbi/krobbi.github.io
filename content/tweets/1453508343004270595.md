        A 3D raycasted environment with a blue sky and a grassy floor. There
        are walls with a brick texture that fade out into a fog colour farther
        away.

Messing about with code and trying to do texture-mapped raycasting. Pretty
pleased with this but it's really messy and inefficient and this probably won't
end up going anywhere.
