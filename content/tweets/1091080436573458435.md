        A level editor for a tile-based side-scrolling video game. Three grass
        tiles and a rock tile are placed in front of a photographed background
        of clouds. Text at the bottom of the screen shows the current position
        and tile of the "brush".

Rewriting engine for JS {{< tweets/hashtag gamedev >}} thing:
* Bitmap fonts
* Camera system
* "Loader" states for data-driven loading screens
* Nicer code
\
Also:
* Moved levels to own class
* Tile layers can be drawn separately
\
Hopefully will be back tomorrow with input and a finished level editor.
