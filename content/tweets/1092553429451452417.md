        A grassy tile-based side-scrolling video game level. A blue bird sprite
        is standing between a sign and a rock. Tall grass covers the sign,
        bird, and rock.

{{< tweets/hashtag tag=gamedev >}} update:\
\
Added entities (stuff that isn't tiles)\
Added tile entities (for interactable stuff such as signs, chests etc.)\
Tilemap layers now drawn separately\
Tiles can reuse graphics from tileset (e.g. tall grass)
