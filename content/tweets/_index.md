title: Twitter Archive
description: Tweets by Krobbizoid

I used to use a Twitter account. Before I deleted my Tweets I wrote a script to
download them to be hosted here.

This is not a 'true' archive. Many of my Tweets are not included. I have
prioritised Tweets that both showcase projects I was working on at the time and
are not too embarrassing. This eases the limited storage capacity on this site.

Missing image alt text has been added, and existing image alt text has been
improved. The original text content has not been touched, but I have added
context sections to some Tweets. HTTP links have also been upgraded to HTTPS.

I have saved a copy of the original Tweets as they were downloaded, but I do
not plan to make this public.
