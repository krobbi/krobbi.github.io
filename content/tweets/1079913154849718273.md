        A raycasted graphic with flat colours. Randomly-placed blocky white
        pillars are standing in water in front of a sunset background. The
        pillars cast shadows into the water and fade out into a fog colour
        farther away.

    This image shows one of my earlier attempts at
    {{< link raycasting "raycasting" >}}. This example was written in
    JavaScript. Textures had not been implemented, but depth-based effects had.
