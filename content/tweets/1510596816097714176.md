        A tile-based top-down video game. A Metal Gear Solid-style radar takes
        up most of the screen. The player is a stick figure with text above
        that reads "Moving".

Radar scale and background opacity is now fully adjustable, so you can have it
look like this if you want. The 'moving' text is just a debug thing for the
finite state machine system.
