    During late 2020 I was trying to explore WebGL as an option for developing
    games. I was familiar with JavaScript and wanted an option with better
    performance than the 2D context. I ended up creating a relatively simple
    {{< link sol "game engine" >}}, but never used it for a full game.

Must be losing my mind because I think I've started to get a feeling of how to
use OpenGL.
