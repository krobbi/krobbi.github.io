        A code snippet of a 'hello world' program. The program is written in a
        simple scripting language, but the source code is passed into a
        bytecode compiler and an interpreter.

    This image shows an early test of 'NightScript' - a custom scripting
    language that was embedded into
    [Coldest Night](https://krobbizoid.itch.io/coldest-night) to handle
    dialogue and cutscenes. This was eventually replaced with a system that
    used the {{< link godot >}} game engine's built-in scripting language,
    GDScript.

Just a simple hello world, nothing funny going on here. :)
