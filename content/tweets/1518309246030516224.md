        A Metal Gear Solid-style video game. The radar displays a guard with a
        yellow vision cone and a subtitle reads "What was that?"

Version 0.6.0 of the demo is out. The player and guards have some temporary
sprites showing a direction and animation. Guards also become suspicious if you
are seen from a distance, instead of an instant game over.\
