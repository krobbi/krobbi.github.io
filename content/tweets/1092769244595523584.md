        A grassy tile-based side-scrolling video game level. A small text box
        with a paper or canvas texture at the top of the screen reads
        "Test Level". A taller and wider dialogue box with the same texture is
        at the bottom of the screen. The dialogue box contains sample text that
        wraps onto a second line.
