# About
krobbi.github.io is a GitHub Pages website hosted at https://krobbi.github.io.
The site contains:
* A homepage.
* A 404 page.
* Software license texts hosted in plaintext.
* CSS stylesheets.
* Favicon images.

# Generating
The site is fully static, meaning all of its pages are stored on the server
with their contents fully rendered. This improves page load performance and
compatibility at the expense of storing larger files with duplicate data.

The static files are generated from this repository using the extended edition
of [Hugo](https://gohugo.io). This is the only dependency. The site is
automatically regenerated and deployed every time it is pushed to GitHub.

# License
The site's content is released under an all rights reserved license. This
repository may be used freely as a reference without credit or permission.

See [LICENSE.txt](./LICENSE.txt) for a full copy of the license text.
